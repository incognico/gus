Requirement (Sven Co-op server side AngelScript plug-in): https://github.com/incognico/svencoop-plugins/blob/master/ChatBridge.as

No support will be provided, as Gus is heavily tailored towards the twilightzone server. This is open source as an example of what's possible with the ChatBridge.as plug-in.
